## Whether to allocate persistent volume disk for the data directory.
## In case of node failure, the node data directory will still persist.
##
## Ref.: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/
#
persistence:
  enabled: true

  ## Define the volume access modes:
  ##
  ## "ReadWriteOnce" => The volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node. ReadWriteOnce access mode still can
  ##                    allow multiple pods to access the volume when the pods are running on the same node.
  ## "ReadOnlyMany" => The volume can be mounted as read-only by many nodes.
  ## "ReadWriteMany" => The volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes.
  ## "ReadWriteOncePod" => The volume can be mounted as read-write by a single Pod. Use ReadWriteOncePod access mode if
  ##                       you want to ensure that only one pod across whole cluster can read that PVC or write to it.
  #
  accessModes:
    - "ReadWriteMany"

  ## Define custom storage annotations:
  ##
  annotations: {}

  ## Define the volume size.
  #
  size: "10Gi"

  ## Define the class of PV.
  storageClassName:

  # Specifies whether a service account should be created
  create: true
  # Automatically mount a ServiceAccount's API credentials?
  automount: true
  # Annotations to add to the service account
